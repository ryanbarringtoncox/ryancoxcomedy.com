                After the competition, Ryan was hooked on writing and delivering jokes that make rooms laugh.  In 2015, Ryan transitioned from competitive speaking to Stand-Up Comedy and he’s never looked back!  Ryan has performed his unique blend of stand-up all over the Southeast, with jokes ranging from crafted one-liners to twisted parenting tales to crowd work. He’s landed punchlines on big stages like the Orange Peel and worked alongside national acts like Pete Lee, Sean Finnerty and Jessimae Peluso. You can catch Ryan at the North Carolina Comedy Festival this Fall in 2023.
